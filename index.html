      <h2>What is the Pomodoro technique?</h2>
      <p>
        The Pomodoro technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.
        It uses a timer to break work into focused intervals (usually 25 minutes), separated by short breaks.

        Each interval is known as a "pomodoro", named after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer the inventor of the method
        used as a university student.
